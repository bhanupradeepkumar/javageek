In Java, the main method is the starting point of a Java program. It is a special method that is called by the Java runtime when the program is executed.

The main method has the following signature:


public static void main(String[] args)

The public keyword indicates that the method is visible and can be called from anywhere. The static keyword indicates that the method is a class method and can be called without creating an instance of the class. The void keyword indicates that the method does not return a value.

The String[] args parameter is an array of String objects that contains any command-line arguments passed to the program.

In the line of code you provided, the throws IOException keyword is added to the main method declaration. This means that the main method is declaring that it might throw an IOException. An IOException is a type of exception that is thrown when an input/output error occurs.

If a method declares that it throws an exception, the calling method must either handle the exception or declare that it also throws the exception. In this case, if the main method throws an IOException, the Java runtime will handle the exception.


The public keyword indicates that the method is visible and can be called from anywhere. The static keyword indicates that the method is a class method and can be called without creating an instance of the class. The void keyword indicates that the method does not return a value.

The String[] args parameter is an array of String objects that contains any command-line arguments passed to the program.

The main method is the entry point of a Java program and is where the program's logic begins. It is required for all Java programs and must be included in order for the program to run.



Sure, I'll explain each step in more detail:

public static void main(String[] args): This line defines the main method of the Java program, which is the entry point of the program. The public keyword indicates that the method can be accessed from anywhere in the program, the static keyword means that the method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class, and the void keyword means that the method doesn't return a value. The String[] args parameter is an array of strings that can be passed as command-line arguments to the program.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);: This line creates a new instance of the Scanner class that reads input from the standard input stream (System.in). The System.in object represents the standard input stream, which by default is the keyboard. The Scanner class provides methods for reading different types of data from an input stream.

System.out.println("enter the number");: This line prints the string "enter the number" to the console. The System.out object represents the standard output stream, which by default is the console.

int p = sc.nextInt();: This line reads an integer value from the standard input stream using the nextInt() method of the Scanner class. The value entered by the user is stored in the integer variable p.

In summary, this code prompts the user to enter an integer value and stores the input value in the variable p. The program then terminates.

Arrays in java are normal class objects
in c & c++ there we have arrays that hold address of memory block
in java array variables are references to objects like they are
normal class objects so they have members like length is
a direct member like dog.breed like that members .

in c and c++ when u write functions that take array
as an argument u required to pass length of array as
additional argument but java length is avaible
fnc get length using array.length

//we can access an array in indexs
begin with 0
they are at contiguous location
10 20 30 40
0   1  2  3
a[1] =50;{[1]a=50 both are same }
it goes to that adress of index 1 changes value to 50

different ways to create an array in java
1st way
declaring a variable a of int array type
int[] a;
after declare allocate memory

how memory allocation works in java
a is a reference varaible or local varaible to function
where u have created it going to be stored in function called
stack and this a = new int[3];
dynamically allocated memory and its going to be created
in Heap but dont have worry about heap allocated memory
in c and c++ deallocated that and in java
garbage collection happens automatically simply allocated
and forget about deallocation


int[] a = new int[3];
a[0]=10;
a[1]=20;
a[2]=30;

int[]a = {10,20,30}
when create u dont know provide data later for use no

int[]a = new int[3]
int x=10;
for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++)
{
a[i]=x;
x=x+10;
}
indexes in array vary from 0 to length -1
if u have array of size 5 indexes will be 0 to 4

if u try to use an index which is not in valid range
then java throws an exception array index out of bound

java avoid runtime things while u developing code exception is
thrown you can fix it

int a[] b;
data type is int and we specified that
this is an array of int type
when we didnt keep [] that means it was a normal variable
b is an integer

int[] a ,b
here we changed data type itself
so b is also array type here
//error int cant be converted to int[]
