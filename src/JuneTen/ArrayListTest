import java.util.ArrayList;
an arraylist should be created of non primitive data type
like create
ArrayList<Integer> a1 = new ArrayList<Integer>();
here Integer is wrapper class of primitive int type

note that it is a collection

a1.add(10);
a1.add(20);

note that add function by default add element at end of arrayList

can create empty or capacity as well like 10 can use like normal

third way is pass the elements in hashset like that

ArrayList Working
like vectors in c++ and lists in pythonn


internally use normal arrays only
preallocate some space and after full
do the following
create a new array of double size
copy elements from old space to new
free old space

time complexity Big O of 1

advantages one is cash friendliness
processors prefetch the items cache
random access is available in arrays
